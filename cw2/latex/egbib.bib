  abstract  = {Artists and fashion designers have recently been creating a new form of art -- Camouflage Art -- which can be used to prevent computer vision algorithms from detecting faces. This digital art technique combines makeup and hair styling, or other modifications such as facial painting to help avoid automatic face-detection. In this paper, we first study the camouflage interference and its effectiveness on several current state of art techniques in face detection/recognition; and then present a tool that can facilitate digital art design for such camouflage that can fool these computer vision algorithms. This tool can find the prominent or decisive features from facial images that constitute the face being recognized; and give suggestions for camouflage options (makeup, styling, paints) on particular facial features or facial parts. Testing of this tool shows that it can effectively aid the artists or designers in creating camouflage-thwarting designs. The evaluation on suggested camouflages applied on 40 celebrities across eight different face recognition systems (both non-commercial or commercial) shows that 82.5% ~ 100% of times the subject is unrecognizable using the suggested camouflage.},

  abstract   = {This paper describes a face detection framework that is capable of processing images extremely rapidly while achieving high detection rates. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second.},
